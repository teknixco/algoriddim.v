Binary Trees and VariantsBinary Trees and Variants
5 Types

Definition
Node: It represents a termination point in a tree.
Root: A tree’s topmost node. 
Parent: Each node (apart from the root) in a tree that has at least one sub-node of its own is called a parent node.
Child: A node that straightway came from a parent node when moving away from the root is the child node.
Leaf Node: These are external nodes. They are the nodes that have no child.
Internal Node: As the name suggests, these are inner nodes with at least one child.
Depth of a Tree: The number of edges from the tree’s node to the root is.
Height of a Tree: It is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. The tree height is also considered the root height.

Composed of
Data element
Pointer to left subtree
Pointer to right subtree

Types of Binary Trees
1. Full Binary Tree - has either 0 children or two children
2. Complete Binary Tree - All nodes are filled with two children except for last level
3. Perfect Binary Tree - All nodes are filled with two children
4. Balanced Binary Tree - The height of the left and right subtrees varys by no more than 1.
5. Degenerate Binary Tree - Every node only has one child.

Benefits of a Binary Tree
The search operation in a binary tree is faster as compared to other trees
Only two traversals are enough to provide the elements in sorted order
It is easy to pick up the maximum and minimum elements
Graph traversal also uses binary trees
Converting different postfix and prefix expressions are possible using binary trees
